Introduction to Research Methods
--------------------------------------
Milestone 5
--------------------------------------
This repository was created for the course Introduction to Research Methods.
Inside this repository is a readme and a shellscript. The repository is used to share the code for the assessment.

The shellscript can be run by using ./de_counter, it is a simple script that outputs the number of occurences of 
the worde 'de' on the dutch wikipedia page of the RuG. The number of occurences found is 282.

The page is taken by the usage of the 'curl' package, and then saved as a copy. The code will then run through this copy
to count the occurencs of the word 'de'.
